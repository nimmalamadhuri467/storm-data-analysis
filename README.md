🌪️ Climate Risk and Disaster Management: NOAA Atlantic Hurricane Dataset (1975-2024)

This project explores the NOAA Atlantic Hurricane dataset (1975-2024) to analyze and understand the impact of hurricanes on climate risk and disaster management. The dataset includes various storm information, such as the storm's ID, date/time, location (latitude/longitude), status, category, wind speed, pressure, and hurricane-force diameter.

Problem Statement

Hurricanes and floods are major natural disasters that cause loss of lives, property damage, and economic disruption. Early prediction of storm severity and flood risk is essential for disaster preparedness and response.
